# Safe Agent: Scheduling influenced by resource usage dynamics

The Safe agent scheduler extender together with a node annotator, which collects statistics from Prometheus (or Metric server), provides a Kubernetes scheduling solution that is influenced by actual resource usage, rather than just resource allocation. This `Safe Scheduler` performs risk-aware (safe) allocation of resources, based on actual and predicted resource usage statistics of each node in the cluster, hence leading to safer placement of workload avoiding noisy neighbors, and reducing probability of evictions. It can also be configured to perform risk-aware over-commitment leading to better cluster utilization. The risk calculation minimizes the probability of exceeding the available resources, thus the name "Safe Scheduler".

## Description

This is an extender to a default Kubernetes scheduler which provides predicates and priority functions with the intent of making safe loading of the nodes. The word "safe" refers to not overloading the nodes and distributing the load, accounting for variability in resource usage, rather than just amount of allocated resources. This extended Kubernetes scheduler uses historical resource usage data to schedule pods as opposed to relying on the specified pod requested demand. Overview and background information is [here](../docs/usageResourceAlloc.pdf). The current version considers two resources: CPU and memory. It is based on the [Kubernetes secheduler example](https://github.com/everpeace/k8s-scheduler-extender-example).

A (separate) data collection [component](../node-annotator/README.md) gathers node resource usage data  (through Prometheus, for example) and annotates the node with such information. For example, data about resource usage is given as follows.

```bash
Annotations:
		mean-free-memory=155597063
		std-free-memory=30372823
		mean-free-cpu=2500
		std-free-cpu=400
		
		forcasted-free-memory=200000000
		forcasted-free-cpu=2000
```

The average usage (mean) and standard deviation (std) quantities are calculated over a period of time. The units for memory and cpu are Bytes and MilliCPU, respectively. Based on the average and standard deviation values, a Beta distribution fit is computed to represent the distribution of resource utilization. Risk is calculated as the probability the utilization is above a given threshold value of utilization, e.g. 90 percent (default). The forecasted quantities are optional and are used to adjust the average values according to a specified forecasting weight.

The `Safe Scheduler`  extends the predicates and priority functions of the default scheduler. It supports Kubernetes 1.13.5.

A predicate function 'safe-overload' accepts a node if the requested pod and the historical load on the node result in a risk that is less than a given percentile value, e.g. 30 percent (default). 

Two priority functions are provided: 'safe-overload' and 'safe-balance'. The former orders nodes based on their calculated risk values. The latter orders nodes according to a combined measure of average and standard deviation of the available resources. Such a combined measure allows a trade-off between the average load and the variability in the load. For example, a node with higher average load, but less variability, may be favored over one with less average load and high variability.

The `Safe Scheduler`  is configurable through the following environment variables: 

```
SAFEUTILIZATION			integer to set the threshold utilization value
SAFEPERCENTILE			integer to set the percentile acceptable value
SAFEFORECASTWEIGHT		integer to set weight percentage of forecast value
SAFEPRINTTABLE			boolean to select detailed logging information
```

An example follows.

```
env:
          - name: SAFEUTILIZATION
            value: "90"
          - name: SAFEPERCENTILE
            value: "30"
          - name: SAFEFORECASTWEIGHT
            value: "20"
          - name: SAFEPRINTTABLE
            value: "false"
```

Samples of deployment yaml files for the `Safe Scheduler` and pods are provided. The scheduler deployment file deploys a pod with two containers: a default scheduler (named my-scheduler) and the `Safe Scheduler` extender. The desired predicates and priority functions to be applied in a given deployment are specified in the ConfigMap specifications. A pod uses the `Safe Scheduler` by asking for the scheduler by name (my-scheduler) as in the [pod creation example](../yamlfiles/test-pod.yaml). A [deployment example](../yamlfiles/extender.safe.yaml) and [output example](../docs/example.pdf) are provided.
